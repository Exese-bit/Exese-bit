**I am currently pursuing a bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering at Lunds University in Lund, Sweden. I have a vested interest in low level engineering, cybersecurity, and software development. Take a look at some of my projects!**

My current focus is on learning C++ and developing my Java graphing calculator -- found in the "graphing-calculator" repository
